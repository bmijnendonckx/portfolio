    return <React.Fragment><p>Hi there!</p>
    <p>My name is <strong>Billy Mijnendonckx</strong>, former student and tech enthusiast. For the past years I've went through a lot of change, both personally as professionally. I've completed 1.5 years of Multimedia Technology (Virtual 3D), at Karel de Grote Hogeschool in Antwerp, with my mind set on becoming a Game Programmer. In the 2nd year of that course however, due to a task I was given to write an essay about any self-chosen topic (I chose Modular Game Design). I decided to pursue Art in the Game Industry.</p>
    <p>In the middle of my 2nd year I went to register for the course Game Graphics Design at Howest in Kortrijk. The year took off with a great start but at the first milestone (test exams, qweek) my mental state and personal issues were conflicting with my studies. I sat through the entire year trying to get back on track but I didn't get there in time. At the end of the year I was ready to start over with the right mind.</p>
    <p>It's 2018, 2 weeks till college starts again and I got to hear that I am not able to reapply because of my shortage of study points. I quickly chose another course but was getting tired of switching courses. Art felt (and still feels) like what I wanted to do although I am not the best at it.</p>
    <p>Through all these years I've learned most out of own practice, documentation and Youtube tutorials. <strong>I'm willing to take this to the field and learn more from experience.</strong></p></React.Fragment>
