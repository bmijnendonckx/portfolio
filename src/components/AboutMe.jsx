    return <div id="about-content"><p>Hi there!</p>
    <p>My name is <strong>Billy Mijnendonckx</strong>, former student and tech enthusiast.</p>
    <p>I've completed 1.5 years of Multimedia Technology (Virtual 3D), at Karel de Grote Hogeschool in Antwerp, with my mind set on becoming a Game Programmer.</p>
    <p>In the 2nd year of that course I decided to do Game Graphics Production at Howest's Digital Arts and Entertainment since I felt that programming was something I can teach myself.</p>
    <p>Due to personal issues that were conflicting with my studies that year, I couldn't continue GGP. Art felt (and still feels) like what I wanted to do although I am not the best at it.</p>
    <p>Through all these years I've learned most out of own practice, documentation and Youtube tutorials. <strong>I'm willing to take this to the field and learn more from experience.</strong></p>
